# Line Tracking in Mixed Reality

We aim to visualize line-tracking on mobile phones in real-time. Our work is based on [ELSED](https://github.com/iago-suarez/ELSED) and [EPLF-VINS](https://github.com/LeiXu1999/EPLF-VINS/tree/main).

This project supports both PC and mobile phone platforms for Line Tracking in Mixed Reality. 

Navigate to the respective subdirectories (`pc/` and `phone/`) for further instructions on setting up and using the implementations on each platform.
