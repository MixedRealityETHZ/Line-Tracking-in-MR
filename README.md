# Line Tracking in Mixed Reality
This Project is a course project of 2023 Fall [Mixed Reality](https://cvg.ethz.ch/lectures/Mixed-Reality/) at ETH. We aim to real-time visualize line-tracking on mobile phones. Our work is based on [ELSED](https://github.com/iago-suarez/ELSED) and [EPLF-VINS](https://github.com/LeiXu1999/EPLF-VINS/tree/main).

```
### How to Debug
Either before or after running the application, type as below:
```bash
<USER_HOME>/.buildozer/android/platform/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat -s "python"
# e.g. /home/sjkim/.buildozer/android/platform/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat -s "python"
```
### Notes
* [Debugger mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) of the mobile phone should be enabled before deploy and run.
* The application does not include explicit asking of the camera permission, though it is needed. Please enable it before running the application.
